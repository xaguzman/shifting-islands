Shifting Islands
------------------------

The original game was written with libgdx 0.9.9. This is a migration to use libgdx 1.1.0 and [my pathfinding library][1] via maven, now with version 0.2.3. The previous version [is here][2]

A game written in java using the [libgdx][3] framework. It was created as a 2014's january entry for the [#1GAM][4] game jam, the theme was respawn. This was coded in about 1 week. It is pretty much only a clone of the 'Room Conveyor Belt' [prototype][5] presented in squidi's three hundred game ideas.
